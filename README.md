# COVID_ca_economic
Project 2

  In an effort to further our understanding of the economic effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, we utilized our skills in Python, SQL, JavaScript and HTML to visualize and understand any potential relationships between the two. First we gathered datasets containing unemployment figures, home prices by county and reported county Covid cases. After reviewing the data we noticed that as the number of Covid cases fluctuated and unemployment numbers increased, so too did home prices. We investigated this trend by cleaning up the datasets using Pandas in Python. Once the cleaning was completed, we constructed a SQL database using PgAdmin and then used Pandas in Python to upload the cleaned datasets to the database. Our aim was to visualize this relationship using JavaScript and HTML to create a few plots and graphs, then load it onto a local server. We were able to accomplish this by creating a connection from our SQL database to our to JavaScript and HTML. The connection was created using the Flask library on top of Python. 
  Once we generate our plots and graphs we can see that although there is a trend in increasing home prices, there is not a strong correlation between the datasets. We were not expecting this result and further leads us to believe there are other economic factors that are contributing to home price increases even though unemployment continues to rise.
